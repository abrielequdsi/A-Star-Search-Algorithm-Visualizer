A\* is a graph traversal and path search algorithm, which is often used in many fields due to its completeness, optimality, and optimal efficiency.

One major practical drawback is its space complexity, as it stores all generated nodes in memory.

Thus, in practical travel-routing systems, it is generally outperformed by algorithms which can pre-process the graph to attain better performance.
